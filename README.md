# PyTorch Linear Regression with 3D Visualization

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using PyTorch, enhanced with 3D visualization of the loss surface. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of linear regression, implement it using PyTorch, and visualize the training process.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following main components:
- **Data Preparation**: Generating sample data for linear regression.
- **Model Definition**: Defining a linear model and the forward pass.
- **Loss Function**: Implementing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.
- **Training Loop**: Training the model by minimizing the loss function using gradient descent.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the data, model predictions, and 3D visualization of the loss surface.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `torch`

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib torch
```

## Usage

1. **Data Generation**:
   - Create the dataset by generating a range of x values and their corresponding y values with added noise.
   
2. **Model Definition**:
   - Define the linear model and the forward function for predictions.
   
3. **Loss Function**:
   - Define the criterion for the loss function using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   
4. **Training Loop**:
   - Train the model using gradient descent and visualize the loss surface.
   
5. **Visualization**:
   - Plot the data and model predictions, and visualize the 3D loss surface.

## Example

An example workflow for training the model and visualizing the results:
1. Generate synthetic data.
2. Define the linear model.
3. Set up the loss function.
4. Implement the training loop to minimize the loss.
5. Visualize the training process and the loss surface.

## Visualization

The project includes enhanced visualization with:
- 3D plots of the loss surface.
- Contour plots of the loss surface.
- Iterative plots of the data and model predictions during training.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of linear regression using PyTorch, covering data generation, model definition, training, and advanced visualization techniques.
